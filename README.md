## Monkeylang Interpreter

Monkeylang Interpreter is an interpreter for a JavaScript-like programming language written in Go. It features a lexer, abstract syntax tree (AST), parser, evaluator, and a REPL, supporting language features such as higher-order functions, closures, and various data structures. This project is designed to follow the principles outlined in Thorsten Ball's book "Writing an Interpreter in Go".
